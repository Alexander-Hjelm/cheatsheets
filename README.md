A documentation over techniques and tools that I use, where I have collected common tasks and scripts so I don't have to DuckDuckGo (tm) them again.

## Updating procedure

I add new entries whenever I encounter a problem I have to DuckDUckGo (tm). I kindly redirect any questions about the update procedure to my own ass.

## Syntax highlighting

Refer to the following reference to see how syntax highlighting works in markdown, and what languages are supported: https://support.codebasehq.com/articles/tips-tricks/syntax-highlighting-in-markdown
